For any task on Planar.jl, consider the entire framework's integrity. Integrate new code seamlessly by utilizing pre-defined types and functions from existing packages. Uphold the codebase's uniformity by strictly observing Julia's standard naming conventions for variables and functions. Whenever we are implementing functions that deal with OHLCV, other data based on timestamps and indicators, remember that they have to support *streaming* data, look at how OnlineTechnicalIndicators is used in the StrategyTools package for reference, because in LiveMode we usually have to recompute(update) values based on fresh data (tick by tick).

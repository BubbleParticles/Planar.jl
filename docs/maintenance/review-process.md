## Reviewer Guidelines

### Providing Effective Feedback

#### Feedback Principles
- **Be Specific**: Point to exact issues with line numbers or examples
- **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements rather than just identifying problems
- **Be Educational**: Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- **Be Encouraging**: Acknowledge good work and effort
- **Be Timely**: Provide feedback within established timeframes

#### Feedback Format
```markdown
## Technical Review

### Issues to Address
1. **Line 45**: The code example is missing the required import statement
   ```julia
   # Add this import at the beginning
   using Planar.Strategies
   ```

2. **Section "Configuration"**: The parameter description is incomplete
   - Current: "Set the timeout value"
   - Suggested: "Set the timeout value in seconds (default: 30, range: 1-300)"

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Consider adding a troubleshooting section for common configuration errors
- The example in Step 3 could benefit from more detailed comments

### Positive Feedback
- Excellent use of progressive examples from simple to complex
- The integration with existing workflow documentation is very helpful

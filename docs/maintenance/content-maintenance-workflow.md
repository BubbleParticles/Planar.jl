# Content Maintenance Workflow

## Overview

This document establishes the processes and procedures for maintaining the Planar documentation to ensure it remains accurate, current, and valuable to users. The workflow covers regular content reviews, user feedback handling, and version control practices.

## Regular Content Review Schedule

### Monthly Reviews
- **First Monday of each month**: Review getting-started content for accuracy
- **Second Monday**: Review API documentation for completeness and accuracy
- **Third Monday**: Review guides and tutorials for currency
- **Fourth Monday**: Review troubleshooting content and update based on recent issues

### Quarterly Reviews
- **Q1**: Comprehensive audit of all installation and setup documentation
- **Q2**: Review and update all code examples for compatibility
- **Q3**: Audit cross-references and links throughout documentation
- **Q4**: Review content structure and navigation effectiveness

### Annual Reviews
- **January**: Complete documentation architecture review
- **July**: User journey and persona validation review

## Content Review Process

## Next Review Date
[Date]
```

## User Feedback Handling Process

### Feedback Collection Methods
1. **GitHub Issues**: Primary method for bug reports and improvement suggestions
2. **Documentation Feedback Forms**: Embedded "Was this helpful?" forms on each page
3. **Community Channels**: Monitor Discord, forums, and other community spaces
4. **Direct User Reports**: Email and direct communication channels

### Feedback Triage Process

#### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Broken links, incorrect code examples, security issues
- **High**: Missing information, confusing explanations, outdated content
- **Medium**: Improvement suggestions, additional examples requests
- **Low**: Style preferences, minor clarifications

#### Response Timeline
- **Critical**: Within 24 hours
- **High**: Within 1 week
- **Medium**: Within 2 weeks
- **Low**: Next scheduled review cycle

### Feedback Processing Workflow

1. **Intake**: Log all feedback in tracking system with priority and category
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate validity and impact of feedback
3. **Assignment**: Assign to appropriate team member or maintainer
4. **Implementation**: Make necessary changes following change control process
5. **Verification**: Test changes and verify they address the feedback
6. **Communication**: Respond to user with resolution details

### Feedback Tracking Template
Create issues using this template:

```markdown
# Documentation Feedback: [Brief Description]

## Source
- [ ] GitHub Issue
- [ ] Feedback Form
- [ ] Community Report
- [ ] Direct Communication

## Priority
- [ ] Critical
- [ ] High
- [ ] Medium
- [ ] Low

## Category
- [ ] Technical Error
- [ ] Missing Information
- [ ] Unclear Explanation
- [ ] Improvement Suggestion
- [ ] Style/Format Issue

## Description
[Detailed description of the feedback]

## Affected Pages/Sections
[List of documentation sections affected]

## Proposed Resolution
[How to address the feedback]

## Implementation Notes
[Technical details for implementation]
```

## Version Control for Documentation Changes

### Branching Strategy
- **main**: Production documentation (published version)
- **develop**: Integration branch for ongoing changes
- **feature/[description]**: Individual feature or content updates
- **hotfix/[description]**: Critical fixes that need immediate deployment

### Change Control Process

#### For Regular Updates
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Make changes following content guidelines
3. Test all code examples and validate links
4. Submit pull request with detailed description
5. Peer review (minimum one reviewer)
6. Merge to `develop` after approval
7. Deploy to staging for final validation
8. Merge to `main` for production deployment

#### For Critical Fixes
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Make minimal necessary changes
3. Test changes thoroughly
4. Submit pull request with critical priority
5. Expedited review process
6. Direct merge to `main` after approval
7. Backport changes to `develop`

### Commit Message Standards
Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

Fixes #issue-number
```

Types:
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `fix`: Bug fixes in documentation
- `feat`: New documentation features
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Content reorganization
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

### Change Documentation
Maintain a changelog in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
# Documentation Changelog

## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New content additions

### Changed
- Modified existing content

### Fixed
- Corrections and bug fixes

### Removed
- Deprecated or outdated content
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Automated Checks
Integrate with existing QA systems:
- Link validation runs on every commit
- Code example testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Template compliance checking
- Spell check and grammar validation

### Manual QA Process
- All changes require peer review
- Critical changes require technical expert review
- User-facing changes require UX review when possible
- Final approval from documentation maintainer

## Maintenance Tools and Scripts

### Automated Maintenance Scripts
Create scripts for common maintenance tasks:

1. **Link Checker**: `scripts/check-links.sh`
2. **Code Example Validator**: `scripts/validate-examples.jl`
3. **Template Compliance**: `scripts/check-templates.sh`
4. **Content Freshness Report**: `scripts/freshness-report.jl`

### Maintenance Dashboard
Track maintenance metrics:
- Last review dates for each section
- Open feedback items by priority
- Link health status
- Code example test results
- Content freshness indicators

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Documentation Maintainer
- Overall responsibility for documentation quality
- Final approval for significant changes
- Coordination of review schedules
- Community feedback oversight

### Content Reviewers
- Subject matter experts for specific sections
- Regular content accuracy validation
- Technical review of changes
- User experience feedback

### Community Contributors
- Submit feedback and improvement suggestions
- Contribute content following contribution guidelines
- Participate in review process when appropriate

## Escalation Process

### When to Escalate
- Critical issues affecting user safety or security
- Conflicting feedback requiring architectural decisions
- Resource constraints preventing timely maintenance
- Technical issues beyond reviewer expertise

### Escalation Path
1. Documentation Maintainer
2. Technical Lead
3. Project Maintainer
4. Steering Committee (for architectural decisions)

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- Percentage of working links (target: >99%)
- Code example success rate (target: 100%)
- Average time to resolve feedback (target: <1 week for high priority)
- Content freshness score (target: <6 months average age)

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- Documentation helpfulness ratings
- User journey completion rates
- Community feedback sentiment
- Support ticket reduction related to documentation

## Review and Improvement

This maintenance workflow should be reviewed and updated:
- Quarterly: Process effectiveness evaluation
- Annually: Complete workflow review and optimization
- As needed: Based on community feedback and changing requirements

The workflow itself should follow the same change control process as the documentation content.

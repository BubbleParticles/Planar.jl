# Development Guides

This section contains comprehensive guides for developing with Planar. These guides provide in-depth coverage of core concepts and practical implementation details.

## Available Guides

- **[Strategy Development](strategy-development.md)** - Complete guide to building trading [strategies](strategy-development.md) using [Julia](https://julialang.org/)'s [dispatch system](../guides/strategy-development.md), covering everything from basic concepts to advanced patterns
- **[Data Management](data-management.md)** - Comprehensive [data management](data-management.md) system for [OHLCV](../guides/data-management.md#ohlcv-data) and time-series [market data](../guides/data-management.md) using multiple collection methods and storage backends
- **[Execution Modes](execution-modes.md)** - Understanding and transitioning between Sim, Paper, and Live trading modes with proper risk management

## Coming Soon

- **Optimization** - Parameter tuning and [backtesting](../guides/execution-modes.md#simulation-mode) [optimization](../optimization.md) techniques
- **Visualization** - Plotting and analysis of [strategy](../guides/strategy-development.md) performance and [market data](../guides/data-management.md)

## Getting Started

If you're new to Planar, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) section first, then working through these guides in order:

1. **Strategy Development** - Learn the core concepts and patterns
2. **Data Management** - Understand how to work with [market data](../guides/data-management.md)
3. **Execution Modes** - Progress from [simulation](../guides/execution-modes.md#simulation-mode) to [live trading](../guides/execution-modes.md#live-mode)

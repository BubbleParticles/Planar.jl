## Basic Julia Examples

Here are some basic Julia operations:

```julia
# Basic arithmetic
a = 10
b = 20
sum = a + b
println("Sum: $sum")
```

Working with arrays:

```julia
# Array operations
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = arr .* 2
println("Original: $arr")
println("Doubled: $doubled")
```

## Non-executable example

This is just pseudo-code and should be skipped:

```julia
# This is just an example - not meant to be executed
SomeHypotheticalFunction(parameters...)
```
